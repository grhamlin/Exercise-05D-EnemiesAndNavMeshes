Create an FPS maze that will be navigated with a first-person perspective.

## Implementation / Features you added

- A first person character than can be controlled by the player
- A maze
- An object that can be interacted with
- At least 1 enemy
- Use of 2 materials
- Use of 2 light sources
- A main menu, and end game screen
- Clear objective
- Score reported in game and on the end screen.

EXTRA FEATURES FOR POINTS:
- Multiple levels (3)
- Different music for menus and levels
- Sound effect when weapon is fired at an enemy
- Creative use of lights or materials
- Attention paid to start and end game experience

EXPLANATION:
- The creative use of lighting is by using a spotlight, and rotating and while adjusting the strength and angle, I was able to create a flashlight for the player to use in the final level of the game. The goal of this was to add the to spooky atmosphere, while also being helpful to the player.
- The attention I paid to the start experience was providing the player with the opportunity to read about the story and the situtuation they are in. It explains why they are in a maze, and why they want to attack the floating cheese.
- The end game experience is a callback to my first two games, which I'm sure you'll recognize. It's something silly but my friend loves it so it's making a return. 
- The whole idea of this game being about a rat fighting cheese while being watching by scientist was very silly and I enjoyed creating the short narrative thoroughly. Although it's not difficult I found myself struggling to find the cheese on the last level more than once. With the music it really can feel spooky wondering aimlessly looking for the enemies.
